## Election Audit Summary
In summary, this analysis' script was done in a general format that could be used for other elections. As long as the raw data has the same format, a number of counties and number of candidates will not impact the scripts functionality. The modifications that may improve this analysis are:
   1. The number of votes and percentage of votes for each candidate be presented by county.
   2. The candidate results by county be presented with a stacked bar graph, to visualize the results.
